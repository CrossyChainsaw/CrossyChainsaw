# About Me ðŸ™‚
I currently study IT & Software Engineering at Fontys. You can see everything I made during my study in the organisation called [Semester Summaries](https://github.com/School-Semester-Summaries).

Also have I been active in the Brawlhalla community making discord bots. Mostly known for creating a bot called Ranknir
